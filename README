Trinidad-Rack
-------------

Library that replaces Trinidad's rack layer from JRuby-Rack to the Mizuno Rack Servlet.

It provides better integration with tools that relie on Rack like Capybara
or any other Rack-Test based tool.

RackServlet is a work of Don Werve and it's licensed under the Apache
License. This library modifies its code to remove the asynchronous layer
bounded to Jetty.

Installation
============

$ jruby -S gem install trinidad_rack

Execution
=========

$ jruby -S trinidad_rack

or

$ rackup -s Trinidad

[IMPORTANT]

This is totally experimental and due to Mizuno and JRuby-Rack
work in a completely different way some features cannot work as expected.
